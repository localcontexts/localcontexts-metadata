More information coming soon, but please visit the [Discussions](https://github.com/localcontexts/localcontexts-metadata/discussions) tab for some of the metadata mappings we are working on.

If you are interested in joining the Technical Implementation Working Group, please complete our Networks Interest Survey [here](http://localcontexts.org/network-interest).
Or, if you are interested in helping us with the mappings in the discussions tab, or any other not there, please reachout to us at [support@localcontexts.org](mailto:support@localcontexts.org).
